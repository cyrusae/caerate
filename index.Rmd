# About this document 

This is a collection of notes and commented code that serves--or at least tries to serve--as an overview of the work I've done with TASCHA over the past year. This means there are several genres of topic being covered:

- *data*, as in information about the nature of the PLS (Public Library Survey) and E-Rate data;
- *tooling*, as in findings and suggestions for script-level changes and upgrades to the existing scripts;
- *scripting*, as in features/code I have written and why;
- *architecture*, plans for long-term development and explanations of why they're like that from my perspective 

It is written in a conversational style because that was more conducive to getting more information down in place as opposed to less information. Thanks in advance for bearing with me on that front.
